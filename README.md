## Abstract

This paper investigates three different sampling techniques for handling five imbalanced medical datasets. The datasets are balanced using SMOTE, Tomek Links and a combination of both SMOTE and Tomek Links. A sensitive (kNN) and a robust classifier (SVM) are used for the evaluation process. Our results suggest that a combination of SMOTE and Tomek Links produce the most accurate classifications of both classes for four out of five datasets, with precision and recall peaking at 99.4% and 99.4% for the kNN and 99.3% and 99.5% for the SVM respectively. These results show that the combination of SMOTE and Tomek Links could be an ideal technique to handle im- balanced datasets.
